## A.I. Duet
Trade melodies with a neural network.

## About

This experiment lets you make music through machine learning. A neural network was trained on many examples and it learns about musical concepts, building a map of notes and timings. You just play a few notes, and see how the neural net responds. Weâ€™re working on putting the experiment on the web so that anyone can play with it. In the meantime, learn about it by watching the video at this link:

## CREDITS

Built by [Yotam Mann](https://github.com/tambien) with friends on the Magenta and Creative Lab teams at Google. It uses [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) and open-source tools from the [Magenta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta) project. Check out more at [A.I. Experiments](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com).

## OVERVIEW

A.I. Duet is composed of two parts, the front-end which is in the 'static' folder and the back-end which is in the 'server' folder. The front-end client creates short midi files using the user's input which is sent to the server. The server takes that midi input and continues it using [Magenta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta) which is then returned back to the client. 

## DOCKER

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source containerization software which simplifies installation across various OSes. It is the simplest method to build and install both the front-end and back-end components. Once you have Docker installed, you can just run: 

```bash
$ sudo docker build -t ai-duet .
$ sudo docker run -t -p 8080:8080 ai-duet
```

You can now play with A.I. Duet at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## FRONT END

If you installed with Docker, the front-end has already been built. To build the client-side javascript outside of Docker, first install [node](https://nodejs.org) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Then you can install of the dependencies of the project by typing the following in the terminal: 

```bash
cd static
npm install
```

Then build all of the files

```bash
webpack -p
```

### BACK END

If you installed with Docker, then these dependencies have already been installed. To build the back-end separately, follow these instructions: 

The back-end consists of a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) server, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Magenta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta). 

First install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html) and [Magenta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta#installation).

To install the rest of the back-end requirements (make sure you have python and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed):

```bash
cd server
pip2 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the server:

```bash
python server.py
```

You can now play with A.I. Duet at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## MIDI SUPPORT

The A.I. Duet supports MIDI keyboard input using [Web Midi API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) and the [WebMIDI](https://github.com/cotejp/webmidi) library. Make sure you refresh the page after plugging in a keyboard to make sure it connects correctly. 

## PIANO KEYBOARD

The piano can also be controlled from your computer keyboard thanks to [Audiokeys](https://github.com/kylestetz/AudioKeys). The center row of the keyboard is the white keys.
