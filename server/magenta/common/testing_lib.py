  """Asserts that two lists are equal without order.

  Given two lists, treat them as sets and test equality. This function only
  requires an __eq__ method to be defined on the objects, and not __hash__
  which set comparison requires. This function removes the burden of defining
  a __hash__ method just for testing.

  This function calls into tf.test.TestCase.assert* methods and behaves
  like a test assert. The function returns if `expected` and `actual`
  contain the same objects regardless of ordering.

  Note, this is an O(n^2) operation and is not suitable for large lists.

    test_case: A tf.test.TestCase instance from a test.
    expected: A list of objects.
    actual: A list of objects.
